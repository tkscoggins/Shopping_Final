# shopping_final
This is the final project for Code Louisville. It is for a shopping site.
This is a shopping website. There is a brief description of the type of shopping site and includes links to the shopping categories through top links and by clicking on the images in each card category. There are bottom links in the footer which take you to additional social media sites that promote the sale items. There is a logo in the center that expands on hover.

The site includes the required mobile first approach and is made using flex elements with 2 media querys for mobile and desktop layouts. Additionally, the burger nav is utilized along with use of the .nth-child in color display of the cards holding clickable images.

There is a sumbmission area for the user to sign up for a newletter and includes a javascript validation of the email entry.
